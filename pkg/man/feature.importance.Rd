\title{Compute feature importance in a model}
\usage{
feature.importance(model, percentage = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{object of class \code{gpb.Booster}.}

\item{percentage}{whether to show importance in relative percentage.}
}
\value{
For a tree model, a \code{data.table} with the following columns:
\itemize{
  \item \code{Feature} Feature names in the model.
  \item \code{Gain} The total gain of this feature's splits.
  \item \code{Cover} The number of observation related to this feature.
  \item \code{Frequency} The number of times a feature splited in trees.
}

\description{
Creates a \code{data.table} of feature importances in a model.
